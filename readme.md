## description This program is a basic inventory management system for a small shop. It allows the user to add product details like ID, name, quantity, and price for up to ten products. The program can also display all saved products, calculate the total value of the inventory, and find which product has the highest and lowest value. It also includes a search option where the user can check product details by entering the product ID. The whole program works using arrays, loops, and simple menus so the user can perform multiple operations easily.
